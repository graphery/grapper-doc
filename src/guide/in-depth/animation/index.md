# Animation

Animating the elements of an SVG graphic is one of the most attractive features available to make
stunning visualizations. To animate an SVG, we can use their native capabilities and the high-level
functionalities offered by Grapper.

Grapper provides a cross-browser compatible, efficient and simple animation solution. It works
internally with CSS and SMIL, selecting the best option in each case and offering a basic API.

The [native SVG animations](../../svg/animation) offer several approaches, each with its own
approach and potential problems. We recommend using Grapper Animation functionality rather than
using native animations directly, although they will always be available for use.

::: warning Prevent animation

When the operating system is configured for not to perform animations, Grapper detects this
configuration and respects the user's settings, changing the values immediately and avoiding showing
transitions or animations.
