# Discover SVG

This guide will show us the capabilities of Scalable Vector Graphics, commonly known as SVG. This
format is based on XML and is natively supported by browsers, not only as image format of the `img`
tag, also as part of the page content. In fact, the browser supports several namespaces, not only in
HTML, also support MathML for mathematical formulas and SVG for representing vector graphics.

Knowing the capabilities of SVG is essential to get the most out of Grapper. If you have not
mastered the SVG format, we invite you to discover its full potential in this introductory guide.
There are exceptional books and tutorials on this type of graphics on the Internet, we invite you to
consult to expand your knowledge after reviewing this guide.
